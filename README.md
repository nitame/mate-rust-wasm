# Just a small project to play with Rust and Web Assembly

This project is aimed to show how to build and deploy a Rust code to wasm and wasi.

There are 3 main steps as follow:

* run a standalone Rust code in the terminal
* run a wasm_bindgen Rust code in the browser
* run a wasi rust code in the terminal

Each step is commit with a tag to ease the switch between code version
